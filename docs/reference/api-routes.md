# API Endpoint Structure (current implementation)

This section documents how the code is actually laid out today, so the
pattern is easy to follow when adding the next event type. See
[docs/data-model.md](../data-model.md) for the Event Model, the long-term
vision (feed/nappy/sleep/pump/etc. as a generalized model) that this
section's backend-api + frontend wiring implements.

## backend-api routes

Authenticated app routes are mounted under `/api/v1/users` and
`/api/v1/babies` in `backend-api/cmd/server/main.go`, behind
`authctx.Middleware` (verifies the `Authorization: Bearer` JWT's
signature/expiry and decodes the caller's identity into context — see
`internal/authctx`):

* `GET /healthz` — unauthenticated.
* `GET /api/v1/users/me` → `GetCurrentUser`; returns the authenticated
  user's id and email for account UI.
* `PATCH /api/v1/users/me` → `UpdateCurrentUser`; updates optional account
  profile fields such as `display_name`.
* `POST /api/v1/babies` → `CreateBaby`. A caller with no existing family
  membership gets a family created implicitly (auto-named, never shown to
  the user) and becomes its owner in the same call; a caller who already
  belongs to a family just gets a sibling baby added to it.
* `GET /api/v1/babies/current` → `GetCurrentBaby`, family-scoped (the
  caller's family's first-created baby, or 404 meaning "no baby yet").
  Includes `has_pending_invite` so the frontend can warn one-active-timeline
  users that they must archive the current baby before joining another
  timeline.
* `PATCH /api/v1/babies/current` → `UpdateCurrentBaby`, owner-only; updates
  current baby profile fields such as name, timezone, birth date, birth
  weight, birth length, and sex.
* `DELETE /api/v1/babies/current` → `ArchiveCurrentBaby`, owner-only; requires
  the caller to confirm the exact baby name and soft-deletes the active baby
  by setting `babies.archived_at`. Archiving also removes the owner's
  membership for that family and revokes their sessions, keeping the current
  product model to one active timeline per user.
* `POST /api/v1/babies/{id}/invite` → `InviteHelper`, baby-scoped and
  owner-only; creates a pending helper invite for the supplied email.
* `GET /api/v1/babies/current/members` → `ListTimelineMembers`, owner-only;
  returns active and invited users with access to the current baby's
  timeline.
* `PATCH /api/v1/babies/current/members/{userID}` →
  `UpdateTimelineMember`, owner-only; updates the member's relationship label
  (profile context such as "Dad", not an authorization role).
* `DELETE /api/v1/babies/current/members/{userID}` →
  `RemoveTimelineMember`, owner-only; cancels pending invites or removes
  active non-owner access. Active removal first asks auth-service to revoke
  the member's still-valid sessions for the family, then deletes the
  `family_members` row.
* `GET /api/v1/babies/current/events` → `ListAllEvents`, the combined feed
  behind the frontend timeline: every event type, merged and ordered
  newest-first (`store.ListAllEvents`, capped at `allEventsLimit`). Supports
  `?date=YYYY-MM-DD`; an omitted date defaults to today. Dates select a
  single calendar day in the baby's timezone.
* `GET /api/v1/babies/current/reports/daily` → `GetDailyReport`, a
  deterministic calendar-day report for the current baby. Supports
  `?date=YYYY-MM-DD`; an omitted date defaults to today. Past dates cover the
  full local calendar day, while today's report runs from midnight to now in
  the baby's timezone. The first version lives in
  `backend-api/internal/handlers/report.go` and summarizes the merged event
  stream into a structured response (`title`, `summary`, `highlights`,
  `generated_at`, `range_start`, `range_end`). This is the backend-owned
  foundation for later AI enrichment; frontend and MCP clients should consume
  the report rather than recalculate its business meaning.
* `GET /api/v1/babies/current/reports/data` → `GetReportData`, the canonical
  factual report-data payload for one to 31 local calendar days. Supports
  inclusive `?start_date=YYYY-MM-DD&end_date=YYYY-MM-DD`; omitting both
  dates defaults to today. The response includes minimal baby context, range
  metadata, factual totals for the whole range, and one deterministic daily
  report plus factual totals and normalized oldest-first events per day. It
  also includes previous-7-day baseline range metadata and totals. It
  intentionally does not include derived metrics or AI output yet.
* `PATCH /api/v1/babies/current/events/{id}` → `UpdateEvent`, type-checked
  generic edit for an existing current-baby event.
* `DELETE /api/v1/babies/current/events/{id}` → `DeleteEvent`, removes one
  current-baby event regardless of type.
* Per event type, nested under its plural resource name (`/nappies`,
  `/feeds`, `/pumps`, `/baths`, `/observations`,
  `/growth-measurements`, ...):
  * `POST /api/v1/babies/current/<resource>` → `Create<Type>`

## The generic event store

There is one `events` table (`event_type TEXT`, `attributes JSONB`,
`occurred_at`, plus id/baby_id/created_at). `store.PostgresStore` exposes
generic event methods, shared by every event type:

* `CreateEvent(ctx, eventType string, attributes map[string]any, occurredAt time.Time) (Event, error)`
* `UpdateEvent(ctx, familyID, babyID, id uuid.UUID, eventType string, attributes map[string]any, occurredAt time.Time) (Event, error)`
* `DeleteEvent(ctx, familyID, babyID, id uuid.UUID) error`
* `ListAllEvents(ctx, familyID, babyID uuid.UUID, from, to time.Time, limit int) ([]Event, error)`

No event-type-specific SQL exists anywhere — a new event type never touches
`store/postgres.go`.

## Per-event-type handler file (backend-api)

Each event type is one file in `backend-api/internal/handlers/` (`nappy.go`,
`feed.go`, `pump.go`, `bath.go`, `observation.go`,
`growth_measurement.go`) containing, and nothing else:

1. A `const eventType<X> = "<x>"` string.
2. Any enum-like type for constrained fields (e.g. `NappyKind`, `FeedType`)
   with a `Valid()` method — only where the field genuinely has a fixed set
   of values. Free-text fields (like observation's `category`) skip this.
3. `create<X>Request` — the JSON body shape.
4. `<x>Response` — the JSON response shape.
5. `<x>FromEvent(ev store.Event) <x>Response` — maps `ev.Attributes` back to
   the typed response, doing any type coercion (see `attributeInt` in
   `feed.go`, reused by `bath.go`, for the JSONB int/float64 quirk).
6. `Create<X>` handler: decode request → validate/trim → build
   `map[string]any` attributes → call the shared
   `createAndRespond(w, r, h, eventType<X>, attributes, occurredAt, <x>FromEvent)`.
7. Combined reads go through `ListAllEvents`; per-type files do not define
   list handlers.

`createAndRespond` (a generic helper in `handlers.go`) owns the actual
`Store.CreateEvent` call, error logging, and JSON response — per-type create
handlers never call the store directly.

**To add a new event type on the backend:** create the new handler file
following the steps above, register its create route in `cmd/server/main.go`,
and add a migration only if the event needs no schema
changes beyond `attributes` (usually it doesn't — JSONB absorbs new fields
without a migration).

## Frontend wiring

`frontend/internal/backendclient` has no per-event-type methods — just
generic `ListEvents(ctx, resource string, date string, out any)`,
`CreateEvent(ctx, resource string, payload map[string]any)`, and
`UpdateEvent(ctx, id string, payload map[string]any)` against
`/api/v1/babies/current/<resource>`. Reads go through the combined
`ListEvents(ctx, "events", selectedDate, &events)` (backend-api's `/events`
endpoint, already merged, date-filtered, and sorted newest-first across
every event type); creates still go through `CreateEvent(ctx, "<resource>", payload)` per type
(`"nappies"`, `"feeds"`, `"pumps"`, `"baths"`, `"observations"`,
`"growth-measurements"`), while edits go through the combined `UpdateEvent`
route. The only shape
`backendclient.go` decodes is the generic `Event` struct (`EventType` plus
an `Attributes map[string]any`) — no per-event-type typed view structs.

The UI is a single merged, chronological timeline (not one list per event
type) fed by a single "Add Event" dialog (not one form per event type).
`frontend/internal/handlers/handlers.go`:

* Every event type is flattened into one presentation shape,
  `TimelineEvent` (`CSSClass`, `Icon`, `TypeLabel`, `Kind`, `Detail`,
  `Time`). `Kind` is the per-type discriminator (nappy's kind, feed/bath's
  type, observation's category; pump intentionally leaves it empty), rendered
  as "(Kind)" next to `TypeLabel`.
  A `<x>TimelineEvent(ev, loc, now)` function builds one from a generic
  `backendclient.Event`, reading its `Attributes` map — this is where
  per-type display text (e.g. feed's "70 ml · 10 min") is decided.
  `timelineEvent(ev, loc, now)` dispatches to the right builder by
  `ev.EventType`, skipping (and logging) any type the frontend doesn't
  recognize.
* `loadTimeline(ctx, loc, selectedDate)` makes one
  `ListEvents(ctx, "events", selectedDate, ...)` call and converts each item to
  a `TimelineEvent` — no client-side merging or sorting; the backend already
  returns one merged, ordered list for the selected date.
* `Index` calls `loadTimeline` and renders the full page.
* `Index` also calls `Backend.GetDailyReport` for the selected date, then
  renders `templates/timeline.html`'s `timeline-workspace` partial. That
  workspace contains both the daily report card and `#timeline`, so HTMX
  event mutations can refresh both together and avoid stale report counts.
* The frontend-only `GET /timeline/events` route renders the event-list
  section for HTMX refreshes. Today's timeline polls that route every 30
  seconds, while older timeline dates stay static. Passive polling does not
  refresh the daily report; create, update, delete, and finish actions still
  refresh the full `timeline-workspace`.
* Each `Create<X>` handler parses the HTML form, builds a `map[string]any`
  payload (plus `occurred_at` via `parseEventTime`), calls
  `Backend.CreateEvent(ctx, "<resource>", payload)`, then calls the shared
  `renderTimeline` (itself `loadTimeline` + selected-date daily-report load
  + render), so every form's htmx response is the same re-sorted, all-types
  `timeline-workspace` partial (`templates/timeline.html`) swapped over
  `#timeline-workspace` with `outerHTML` — never a per-type partial. The
  selected date is carried in each form/delete request so HTMX refreshes
  preserve the parent's current view.
* `UpdateEvent` uses the same `renderTimeline` tail after patching the
  combined `/events/{id}` route. Timeline quick actions for ongoing feeds
  and sleeps post to frontend-only finish routes (`/events/{id}/finish-feed`
  and `/events/{id}/finish-sleep`), which preserve the original event start
  time and call the same backend update route with a calculated duration.

On the client, `frontend/static/app.js` drives the "Add Event" dialog: a
type-picker step (one button per event type) followed by a
form-fields step showing only the chosen type's `<form class="event-form"
data-type="...">` block from `templates/index.html`. Each form still posts
straight to its own existing endpoint (`/nappies`, `/feeds`, `/pumps`, ...); the
dialog only changes what's *shown*, not the request shape.

**To add a new event type on the frontend:** add a `<x>TimelineEvent`
builder in `handlers.go` (reading from `ev.Attributes`) and a case for it
in `timelineEvent`'s switch; add a `Create<X>` handler ending in
`h.renderTimeline(...)`; add a `<x>` type-choice button and its `.event-form
data-type="<x>"` block in `index.html`; add a `<x>: "Log a <x>"` entry to
`typeLabels` in `app.js`; wire the create/list routes for the new resource
in `cmd/server/main.go` (`/events` already returns every type, no change
needed there); and give the new card colour a light/dark pair in
`style.css`.
